# Python-Beginner-Wordle-Terminal
This program allows the user to play with the terminal by randomly generating a 5 letter word and the user has to guess a 5 letter word and see how close they are to the randomly chosen word.
- B means black, this means that the letter in that position is not in the chosen word
- Y means yellow, this corresponding letter is in the final word but its not in the correct spot
- G means green, the letter that matches the position of the word is the right letter in the right spot
You're given 6 chances to guess the word, so use the information given wisely.
